# "Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning" Reading Group at Northwestern Statistics

This page serves as a repository for resources of the 2018-2019 reading group "Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning" at Department of Statistics at Northwestern University. In Fall 2021, this is set to be held weekly/bi-weekly (flexible) on Wednesday 2pm-3:30pm. 

We mainly follow the recently published textbook ["Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction"](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) by Kevin Murphy at Google Research. The textbook pdf can be accessed [here](https://github.com/probml/pml-book/releases/latest/download/book1.pdf). 

Several textbooks can also be used for reference, including (but not limited to): 
1. [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](**http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf**) by Christopher M. Bishop
2. [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) by David J.C. MacKay
3. [Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective](https://iie.fing.edu.uy/~nacho/docs/libros/machine_learning_a_bayesian_perspective.pdf) by Sergios Theodoridis

We mainly focus on the statistical and computational perspectives of machine learning.
