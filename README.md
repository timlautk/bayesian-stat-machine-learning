# "Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning" Working Group at Northwestern Statistics

This page serves as a repository for resources of the 2021-2022 working group "Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning" at Department of Statistics at Northwestern University. In Fall 2021, this is set to be held weekly/bi-weekly (flexible) on Wednesday 2pm-3:30pm. 

We mainly follow the recently published textbook ["Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction"](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) by Kevin Murphy at Google Research. The textbook pdf can be accessed [here](https://github.com/probml/pml-book/releases/latest/download/book1.pdf). 

Several textbooks can also be used for reference, including (but not limited to): 
1. [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) by Christopher M. Bishop
2. [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) by David J.C. MacKay
3. [Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective](https://iie.fing.edu.uy/~nacho/docs/libros/machine_learning_a_bayesian_perspective.pdf) by Sergios Theodoridis
4. [Learning Theory from First Principles](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf) by Francis Bach
5. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning (Second Edition)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani
6. [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction (Second Edition)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman

We mainly focus on the statistical and computational perspectives of machine learning.
