# "Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning" Reading Group at Northwestern Statistics

This page serves as a repository for resources of the 2018-2019 reading group "Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning" at Department of Statistics at Northwestern University. In Fall 2018, this is set to be held bi-weekly on Friday at noon. 

We mainly follow the course  materials of ["Bayesian Models for Machine Learning"](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E6720/Fall2018/E6720Fall2018.html) and [Advanced Probabilistic Machine Learning](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E9801/E9801Fall2014.html) by Prof. John Paisley at Columbia. The past course notes can be accessed [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E6720/BayesianModelsMachineLearning2016.pdf) and [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E9801/notes/APML_lecture_notes.pdf). 

Several textbooks can also be used for reference, including (but not limited to): 
1. [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) by Christopher M. Bishop
2. [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) by David J.C. MacKay
3. [Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective](https://iie.fing.edu.uy/~nacho/docs/libros/machine_learning_a_bayesian_perspective.pdf) by Sergios Theodoridis

To supplement the theory content in above materials, we will also learn Python with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (a computational library by Google, mainly for deep learning but is also a general purpose optimizer) with [TensorFlow Probability](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability) (a library for probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis in TensorFlow). The example code will be maintained in this GitHub repository.
